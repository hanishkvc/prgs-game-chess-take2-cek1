If already Under CHECK
1.0 cb_findbest
1.1. initially evaluates current position/situation
1.2. If check identified flag is set(thro increment).
1.3. List of moves is generated.
1.4. moves_process is called
2.0. moves_process
2.1. Creates a new chessboard with the currently evaluatin move executed.
2.2. cb_findbest called.
3.0. cb_findbest
3.1. evaluates current position
3.2. if still in check flag is incremented
3.3. return telling Error, because the king is still in check.

If entering CHECK, on a new move 
1.0 cb_findbest
1.1. initially evaluates current position/situation
1.2. As no check - flag is Not set (or rather cleared)
1.3. List of moves is generated.
1.4. moves_process is called
2.0. moves_process
2.1. Creates a new chessboard with the currently evaluatin move executed.
2.2. cb_findbest called.
3.0. cb_findbest
3.1. evaluates current position
3.2. As check identified flag is set (thro increment)
3.3. HOWTO IDENTIFY this situation and return with error.

To differentiate between both, may be use curDepth field to return immidiately in 2nd case at 3.0
OR check who is supposed to move next and who is already undercheck and then decide whether to
continue or not.
